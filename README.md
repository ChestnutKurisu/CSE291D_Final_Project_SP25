# Wave Simulation Examples

This repository contains a minimal framework for simulating and animating simple wave phenomena.

Only a subset of the requested 70 wave types is implemented. Currently there are basic demonstrations
of seismic P-waves and S-waves using a 2D finite difference solver.

Animations can be generated via `examples/collage.py` which will output small MP4 files for
these two waves. The script can be expanded with additional simulations as they become available.

Due to time and resource constraints the remaining wave types are not implemented. Contributions
are welcome.
